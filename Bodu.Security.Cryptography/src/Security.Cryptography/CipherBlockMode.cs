		/// </summary>
		/// <remarks>
		/// <para>
		/// ECB is the simplest mode and allows parallel encryption/decryption of blocks. However, it is insecure for most applications
		/// because identical plaintext blocks yield identical ciphertext blocks, revealing patterns in the data.

		/// Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. Each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption.
		/// </summary>
		/// <remarks>
		/// <para>
		/// CBC provides confidentiality by chaining ciphertext blocks, so identical plaintext blocks produce different ciphertexts
		/// (assuming different IVs). The first block uses an initialization vector (IV) instead of a previous ciphertext block.
		/// </para>

		/// plaintext or ciphertext.
		/// </summary>
		/// <remarks>
		/// <para>
		/// CFB turns a block cipher into a self-synchronizing stream cipher. It supports partial block encryption and can recover from bit

		/// Output Feedback (OFB) mode. Encrypts the previous output (or IV) to produce a keystream that is XORed with the plaintext or ciphertext.
		/// </summary>
		/// <remarks>
		/// <para>
		/// OFB is similar to CFB but uses the previous keystream block rather than ciphertext, making it immune to bit-flip propagation. It
		/// operates like a synchronous stream cipher. The IV seeds the initial encryption.
		/// </para>

		/// Counter (CTR) mode. Uses a counter value that is encrypted to produce a keystream, which is XORed with plaintext or ciphertext.
		/// </summary>
		/// <remarks>
		/// <para>
		/// CTR transforms a block cipher into a stream cipher by encrypting a monotonically incremented counter (usually seeded with an
		/// IV). It allows parallel encryption and decryption and is suitable for high-performance applications.
		/// </para>
		/// <para>This mode requires a nonce or IV of block size length to initialize the counter.</para>
