	/// This class simplifies creation of lightweight hash algorithm factories that encapsulate algorithm configuration logic, particularly
	/// useful for one-shot hashing scenarios where consumers need to consistently configure algorithm instances (e.g., setting a key,
	/// tuning rounds, or enabling specific variants).
	/// <para>
	/// The returned factory instances are typically passed into <see cref="HashAlgorithmHelper" /> methods to compute hashes from spans,
	/// streams, or buffers in a memory-safe and reusable way.
