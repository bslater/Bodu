	/// Cipher modes determine how blocks of plaintext or ciphertext are processed in sequence using a block cipher. Implementations of this
	/// interface are responsible for managing the internal state required by the mode, such as initialization vectors (IVs) or feedback registers.

	/// This interface is intended to be used in conjunction with an <see cref="IBlockCipher" /> implementation. Padding of the input data,
	/// if required, must be handled separately.
