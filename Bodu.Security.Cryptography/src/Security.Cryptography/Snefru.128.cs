	/// <summary>
	/// Computes the hash for the input data using the <c>Snefru-128</c> hash algorithm. This variant applies a symmetric, non-keyed block
	/// transformation using a fixed sequence of S-box and bit rotation rounds. This class cannot be inherited.

	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// <see cref="Snefru128" /> computes a 128-bit (16-byte) hash using 8 rounds of transformation over a 512-bit working buffer. The
	/// algorithm uses a 4-word (32-bit unsigned integer) internal state and processes input data in fixed 64-byte blocks.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Each round consists of an S-box substitution stage followed by a word-wise circular rotation phase. The S-box logic uses precomputed
	/// lookup tables to inject non-linearity, while rotations ensure data diffusion across the buffer. After all rounds, the result is
	/// XORed back into the internal state.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Input blocks are padded using double-length padding (2 × block size), with the total bit length encoded in the final 8 bytes. The
	/// final state is serialized in big-endian byte order to produce the resulting hash.
	/// </para>
	/// <note type="important">This algorithm is <b>not</b> suitable for cryptographic applications such as password hashing, digital
	/// signatures, or secure data integrity checks.</note>
