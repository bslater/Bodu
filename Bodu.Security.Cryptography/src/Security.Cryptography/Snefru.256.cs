	/// <see cref="Snefru256" /> computes a 256-bit (32-byte) hash using 8 rounds of transformation applied to 64-byte input blocks. It
	/// maintains an 8-element internal state of 32-bit unsigned integers, with output produced after mixing and finalization.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// The core transformation involves alternating S-box substitutions and circular bit rotations. Each S-box round updates surrounding
	/// buffer words based on fixed lookup tables. Rotations vary across rounds to promote cross-word diffusion. The permuted buffer values
	/// are XORed back into the internal state.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// Input is padded to 128 bytes (2 × block size), appending the total message bit length at the end. The final state is written in
	/// big-endian format to produce the final digest.
