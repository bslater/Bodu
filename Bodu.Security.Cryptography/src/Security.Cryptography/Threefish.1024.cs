	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// This class derives from <see cref="Threefish" /> and configures the algorithm for the <c>Threefish-1024</c> variant, which operates
	/// on 1024-bit blocks using a 1024-bit key and a 128-bit tweak.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// It supports a variety of cipher block modes (e.g., CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR) via the <see cref="Threefish.BlockMode" /> property,
	/// replacing the standard <see cref="SymmetricAlgorithm.Mode" /> property to allow for custom or non-standard modes.
	/// </para>
	/// <para>
	/// This implementation is designed to integrate with the .NET cryptographic framework and supports tweakable encryption for enhanced
	/// security scenarios such as disk encryption or format-preserving encryption.
